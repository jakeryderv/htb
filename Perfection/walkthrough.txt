Started with NMAP scanning and found:
    * port 22 open (ssh)
    * port 80 open (http)

Went to website and found:
    * uses Ruby,WEbrick,
    * then searched for exploits and vulnerabilities related to these technologies

Website had calc form:
    * tried to inject different types and formats of input to see if anything that isn't excected could get through
    * we used burpsuite to monitor this and the different requests

Confirmed input valudation vulnerability:
    * found a format of inputting 7*7 that returned 49, confirming that input validation was the vulnerability (chris could tell you more about this format)
    * then identified that ruby uses `backticks` to access and use console commands so we then surrounded `ls` with backticks and were able to output the files and directories

reverse shell
    * used netcat to listen for reverse shell and were able to input reverse shell commands into machine through the input validation vulnerability we found
    * we then got access to the console on our local machine

finding user flag:
    * found the hash of the user password in a file
    * found password format in email dir and ran it through hashcat to crack it

finding root flag:
    * went to root dir and found root flag
